# X-Ray-App
<p>
<b> This is Streamlit Implementation of This Repo: https://github.com/akshat231/X-Ray-ML
  <p> Sadly, I can't refine Images to remove texts and other things from X-Ray Images because apparently you can't use any type of ML Algo inside Streamlit Program</p><hr>
  <p><p>Steps to make Streamlit App:<BR><br><b>1.<b>     First Push all these Files into a repo in Github<br><br><b> NOTE:- IF YOUR MODEL FILE IS ABOVE 25 MB THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO PUSH IT VIA "BASH"
  OR "CMD" OR ANY OTHER CLI. IT WILL NOT BE UPLOADED MANUALLY. AND IF IT IS GREATER THAN 100MB THEN THERE IS LFS<BR><br>2.<b> Login in Stream Share Platform and link your Github Account
  <br><br>3. Click on New App and link your GitHub Repo and also the name of main file Which in this case is "ml_app_newest"
  <br><br>4. Then it will hopefully pop up!!!
